Blender files for the maps are found in the Development Assets. if you haven't downloaded them, go to "https://archive.org/download/PWC-Development-Assets/Development%20Assets/" and download "Maps.zip".
If you have made the changes as mentioned below, let me know, sent me the files and I'll update it, and test it out for revisions.
Blender, Maya or a similar software is required to create the models as their listed below.

==Canterlot High==

- Add the Doctor's Room in any room that has the yellow background on the walls, but the floors on that room has to be replaced.
- There should be more than one benches near the soccer field.
- There should be a sports commentary near the soccer field.
- There needs to be rails on the stairs in the library.
- Create and add the Copier Printer Scanner Machine into the library.
- Create and replace the Monitor and Keyboard Models based on the series, due to the ones not fitting it's art style.
- There needs to be three Dovetail flags on the ceiling in the library.
- Create and add more trees and bushes to avoid seeing mostly empty space.
- Remove all three pictures of Sunset Shimmer found in Principal Celestia's office.
- There should be a Woodshop, Portrait and another room identical to the big classroom found in floor 2, but with the walls and floors differently coloured, inside the school. You can put the rooms in floor 3, but wall and floors for certain rooms in floor 3 might have to be adjusted.
- (Optional) Create a seperate (but bigger) Library room, (keep the library room that's connected into the stage before entering) since there's more bookshelves in the back, and the stair height has to be 13 instead of 34.

==Sunset Shimmer's Apartment==

- Create and replace the Keyboard Models based on the series, due to the ones not fitting it's art style.
- Add more buildings in Sunset Shimmer's Apartment (Especially when looking out the window inside).

==Amphitheater==

The Amphitheater model (in Blender) is too small, enlarge it.
There needs to be an extra platform for the drums on the stage.
The Amphitheater model needs to be redone to look identical to its appearance in Rainbow Rocks. (The seats are too far from the speakers, the room behind the stage needs to be bigger like the height has to be adjusted and the roof that's attached to the stage isn't curved.
The wall textures (that's attached to the seats) needs a clean up. (a tiny bit of realistic wall texture showing and there needs to be rectangle shapes in the wall)
(Note: Until the first task is complete, don't do the following tasks until later.)
There should be stuff under the stage instead of empty space (the room where the mane 7 fell through in Rainbow Rocks, wire hoses attached to the wall, microphone stand and speakers should be in there.)

==For All Maps==

- (Optional) Create and add graphical textures to other houses and buildings.

==Notes==

- If chosen to recreate the maps from scratch, please have the maps look exactly like it was when it was first made (albeit with some changes as listed above).
- The character model parts needs to be created seperately, (hair, head, arms and hands, shirt, skirt, legs, shoes) as they were like that when the models were first made, and all were combined in another file by importing them. (unless if a long-sleeved shirt or jacket is made, only apply the hands, or if the character doesn't wear shoes, but flip flops or slippers, only apply the legs and feet together, or if it's Applejack's pajamas which is (Blanket Sleeper) which cover's the body except for the hands.

---------------

- As for the characters, "blender" files are included, since I had to download and import them to blender (credits are in "TitleScreen" found in the Assets folder), the only things that needs to be adjusted is the bones to the characters, I included both "BoneFix" files for better results.)

==Character Models, Props and other textures==

- Sci-Twi's glasses on her "Sci-Twi", "Shorts" and "Camping" outfits doesn't have temples included on her glasses.
- Applejack's Pajamas Outfit is a "Blanket Sleeper", and her Pajama's Outfit model does not cover her feet.
- Sindroom's V2 and V3 Character Models; (no disrespect) is not allowed, because I want the original models to be more faithful to the original materials, Wallflower Blush, Fleur De Lis and Coco Pommel were all made in these types, but has to be remodeled like the rest, textures however can be left intact.
- Create Facial Shapekeys for character models.
- Add Eyebrows for Spike.
- Create Sunset Shimmer's Guitar that she uses for The Rainbooms.
- Rainbow Dash's guitar model doesn't have a strap.
- Pinkie Pie's waitress hair model doesn't have a black hairband on her hair.
- Sunset Shimmer's pajama shirt's neckline needs to be a little bit more bigger.
- Create two seperate hair models for the mane 7, one with wet hair when jumping into the water and singed hair when getting electrocuted.
- The images in concept (found in the development assets) has a list that needs to be modeled.
- Micro Chips's model needs to have laces on his shoes.
- Add temples to Silver Spoon and Sugar Coat's glasses.
- Only changes need for Fluttershy's "Rainbow Rocks Shorts" outfit is that her skirt's length needs to be a little longer.
